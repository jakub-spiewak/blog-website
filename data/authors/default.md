I'm the fullstack developer at CodeLab. I like to __resolve problems, help, teach__ and __share__.

My interests are focused mainly on microservices and making whole applications from frontend through devops to backend. 
I do 
things in __Java, Kotlin, Spring, TypeScript , React, Docker, Git__ and all different technologies 
related to those. Daily I discover new technologies and frameworks, try to make my code cleaner and get the job done 
for my personal clients.
